## TECHNICAL_DEBT
- ReactiveUI.WPF version compatibility warning (using .NET Framework version in .NET 6.0 project)
- Need to implement proper dependency injection container
- Missing unit tests
- Missing logging implementation
- Missing error handling in many places
- Need to implement IEventBus for event handling
- Need to implement IDialogService for UI dialogs
- Need to implement IMessageService for user notifications

## ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS
- Using MVVM pattern with WPF
- Domain-driven design with clean architecture layers
- Value objects for Money and Coordinate
- Repository pattern for data access
- Strategy pattern for AI behaviors
- Command pattern for user actions
- Observer pattern for game events
- Service layer for business logic encapsulation

## CURRENT_STATE
- Basic UI shell running without errors
- Core domain entities fully defined
- Sample data displaying in UI
- Basic command bindings working
- Core application services implemented (Dice, Route, Property)
- GameManager central coordinator implemented
- AI with multiple strategies implemented
- All card effects implemented
- Ready to implement infrastructure services and connect everything
